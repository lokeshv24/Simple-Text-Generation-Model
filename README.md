## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a text generation model that learns to generate coherent text sequences based on given inputs. The solution leverages modern deep learning frameworks and pretrained models.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- Libraries: `transformers`, `torch`/`tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lokeshv24/Simple-Text-Generation-Model.git
   cd text-generation-model
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Implementation

### Key Steps
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess a text dataset (e.g., news articles, books, or custom data).
   - Tokenize text using a pretrained tokenizer (e.g., T5Tokenizer, GPTTokenizer).

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Use a transformer model (e.g., T5, GPT-2) pretrained on a large corpus, fine-tuned for text generation.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the model with appropriate hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
   - Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate on unseen data using metrics like BLEU, perplexity, or ROUGE.

## Challenges
### 1. **Data Imbalance**  
- *Issue*: Uneven distribution of text lengths.  
- *Resolution*: Augmented the dataset to create balanced samples.

### 2. **Overfitting**  
- *Issue*: Model performance degraded on validation data.  
- *Resolution*: Used dropout layers and early stopping.

### 3. **Training Time**  
- *Issue*: Long training durations due to dataset size.  
- *Resolution*: Leveraged cloud GPUs and optimized batch sizes.

---

## Potential Improvements
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use grid search or Bayesian optimization for tuning.  
- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporate a more diverse dataset for better generalization.  
- **Model Efficiency**: Use quantization or distillation to improve inference time.  
- **Advanced Metrics**: Integrate METEOR, CIDEr, or other relevant evaluation metrics.

## Usage

### Training the Model
Run the script to train the model:
```bash
python train.py --dataset "path/to/dataset" --model "T5-small"
```

### Generating Text
Generate text using the trained model:
```bash
python generate.py --input "Your input text here"
```

### Example Output
Input: `"The future of AI is"`  
Output: `"The future of AI is bright with endless possibilities for innovation and creativity."`
