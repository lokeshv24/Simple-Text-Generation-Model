      "\n",
      "Linguistic analysis, or NLP (Natural language processing, or NLP as computers recognise spoken expressions instead of sentences) is a technology that combines machine analysis with the application of human natural language processing - what this usually means is that the computer has developed and adapted its own model to the nature of the things it is examining but at the same time this model learns from the environment as well. In some ways, linguistic algorithms are just speech or music recognition systems but at the same time linguistic applications are quite diverse, from natural language search and translation systems to machine learning and machine translation of text, to natural language editing. What has often caught the attention of both developers and researchers in artificial intelligence and natural languages computing is the possibility that it involves language knowledge and this research is a reflection of the way people work from today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural languages are written from within a particular culture or language. This language/culture is passed around through history and, although the details are not always clear, our own language is still what we speak every day, even some years later when we change our own cultures. If we speak French and our family member wants to order us a nice meal, the customer has spoken French, the restaurant knows what cuisine has been prepared by our own families since the last year and, since we don't yet learn French (or learn English well enough to comprehend French), the language we use and which words are used we use ourselves rather than the words we read on an academic paper.\n",

      "\n",
      "I discovered NLP when I was working with a group of kids at a high school, and the teachers would ask them to type out some sentences about what they wanted to do, and they would be able to understand it. They would write it down as a word list and we would then try to explain what that meant to them, and then they could do it on a computer screen and the computer would translate it.\n",

      "How did you get started with natural language processing?\n",
      "\n",
      "We were talking about it in the office, and one of the teachers said, \"Well, we should start with a language, or a language with a certain meaning, and see how we can apply it to natural language. So we started thinking of natural languages with meaning.\" I'm a linguist, so I knew it was a very important area for me to pursue. We started with some words, but the first step was to learn to write sentences that could be understood in a language that could actually communicate with us in that language.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who have never heard of NLP, but I want to get the word out there and give you the idea of how it actually works. NLP can actually be very helpful to people with disabilities or those with sensory problems, and it's a great way to understand how they can do things without using words.

      "While there are some efficient weapons in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there is more than can be expected from significant advances of a few years given the limited resources required to understand and produce such systems. One and a half years ago a group of researchers from New York University and the University of Pennsylvania, Amos Cohen, and Atul Gupta analyzed the tonal and kinematic properties of acoustic-like sounds ranging from rap music to words in everyday speech. In the following years they settled on a classification system for the sounds and developed algorithms for identifying the opposition to each tone in many tones as well as distinguishing human from robot sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second most fundamental approach that advanced artificial intelligence has used to date is speech recognition. After obtaining early results showing the revolutionary abilities of spoken words, AGI became critical to computer systems that decipher human speech and imitate it.Artificial general intelligence has followed in the footsteps of handwritten print, literal translation and syntactic ideal grammars in reading paper. Readings have gained significant speed, but reading problems have remained. By one recent estimate, human to robot translation calls 90 days at rate of 30 megs per second. Image processing has been relatively successful while, to date, the accuracy of task translation is even lower. At the same time, deep learning continues to push the envelope of machine learning, reaching resolutions of up to 1000 error rates per model.Artificial general intelligence at large training data villages with data repositories, task maps, relationships between models and computer servers were established. In recent years, high-performance systems available for bot tasks, converting to speech recognition, have been largely independent of this class of search low-level machinery. At seminars and workshops on AI, we have discussed the use of language processing systems not accessible to practice, still left unanswered questions for potential applications.\n",
